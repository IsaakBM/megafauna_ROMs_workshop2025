# Workshop overview

The objective of this workshop is to bring together regional experts in climate and ocean modeling to assess the current state of knowledge and modeling capacity in the Southeast Pacific. As part of the [Save the Blue Five](https://savethebluefive.net/) initiative, this meeting aims to identify what regional models and datasets are currently available, what key elements are missing, and how to strengthen the development and application of Regional Ocean Models (ROMs) to support marine conservation research.

Participants will explore the state of the art in existing ROMs, focusing on their ability to represent key oceanographic features such as ocean fronts, upwelling systems, and other dynamic and ephemeral structuresâ€”critical for understanding the movements and habitats of highly migratory species vulnerable to climate change. The ultimate goal is to advance a regional ocean-climate modeling agenda that informs evidence-based marine spatial planning, conservation strategies, and climate adaptation in the Southeast Pacific.
