# Session 5: Integration and Recommendations (09:15 – 10:30)

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
-   **Focus**: This final morning session is designed to bring everything together. After identifying key datasets, variables, and modeling frameworks, we will now turn to integration — how do we translate all of this into actionable outputs for conservation? The session will emphasize cross-cutting recommendations, from setting regional modeling priorities to strengthening collaboration, data sharing, and capacity building. The goal is to outline concrete, forward-looking steps that can guide next-phase efforts across the region and global.

-   **Cross-cutting discussion: How do we move from ROMs to applied outputs for conservation?**

    -   How do we ensure model outputs are usable and relevant to conservation practitioners?
    -   What spatial and temporal scales are most appropriate for decision-making?
    -   Can we identify common workflows or templates to support future applications?

-   **Recommendations for regional modeling priorities**

    -   Which regions, variables, or species groups require immediate attention?
    -   How do we balance near-term needs with long-term modeling goals?
    -   Where do we need higher resolution or ensemble model efforts?

-   **Recommendations for collaborations and data sharing**

    -   Which institutions or networks should be engaged or reconnected?
    -   Are there existing platforms for sharing datasets and code?

-   **Recommendations for capacity building and training needs**

    -   What skill gaps exist (e.g., ROMs, SDMs, climate scenarios, coding)?
    -   Are there opportunities for joint training programs, mentoring, or knowledge exchange?
    -   What kind of support is needecd to scale up regional capacity?

-   **Timelines**

    -   What short-term actions (0–3 months) should be prioritized?\
        (e.g., sharing workshop outputs, organizing a virtual debrief, compiling recommendations)
    -   What medium-term steps (3–6 months) can advance collaboration and modeling work?\
        (e.g., forming working groups, initiating joint modeling or data-sharing efforts)
    -   What long-term goals (6–12 months) should guide regional modeling and capacity building?\
        (e.g., co-developing proposals, publishing results, launching training initiatives)
    -   How do we maintain momentum and track progress over time?

# Session 6: Implications of workshop outcomes (11:00 – 12:30)

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
-   **Final Q&A and Outstanding Points (11:00–11:30)**

    -   Open floor for unresolved questions or clarifications
    -   Reflections on cross-cutting topics that emerged across sessions
    -   Opportunity to comment on anything not yet addressed

-   **Workshop Synthesis and Concluding Statements (11:30–12:00)**

    -   Summary of key insights, priorities, and proposed recommendations
    -   Quick round: What resonated most or shifted your perspective this week?
    -   Final reflections from organizers or facilitators

-   **Reflections & Roadmap (12:00–12:30)**

    -   What short-term steps or follow-ups can we commit to?
    -   Are there opportunities for joint outputs, shared protocols, or working groups?
    -   Next touchpoint: Would a short debrief or coordination call be useful?

**Closing remarks and appreciation**
