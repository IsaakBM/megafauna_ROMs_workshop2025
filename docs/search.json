These case studies will help us evaluate how ROM outputs are being used (or could be used) to inform megafauna modeling and planning efforts.\n\nBuilding on these examples and our previous discussions on data availability, we will then turn to the key environmental and climate variables needed to model species distributions and support marine spatial planning. We will review which variables are most ecologically relevant, how to incorporate climate modes like ENSO into models, and how to represent dynamic oceanographic features such as thermal and dynamical fronts. The discussion will also help distinguish which variables are feasible to integrate now, and which may require phased inclusion as data access and modeling capacity improve.\n\nPresentations: (15 minutes max)\n\nYulia Egorova ‚Äì AquaX models and Migramar working group\nIsaac Brito-Morales ‚Äì Save the Blue 5: climate-change assessment\nLee Hannah ‚Äì Digital twins and ROMs in conservation\nAlex Forryan / Cesar Pe√±aherrera ‚Äì Planned applications of ROMs in upcoming Migramar efforts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCoffee break (10.15 - 10.30)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSession 3 (cont.): Variables of Interest for Conservation-Linked Modeling (10:30 ‚Äì 12:30)\n\n\n\n\nReview of key variables needed for modeling megafauna distributions and informing marine spatial planning\n\nWhat are the core environmental drivers of species occurrence and movement?\nHow do different species groups (cetaceans, turtles, sharks/rays) respond to different variables?\n\nCore physical and biogeochemical variables for SDMs\n\nTemperature (surface and depth-specific), salinity, dissolved oxygen\nCurrents (direction and strength at different depths), mixed layer depth\nNutrients (nitrate, phosphate), pH, chlorophyll-a, net primary productivity\nBathymetry, slope, distance to coast, eddy kinetic energy\nOceanographic features (e.g., upwelling zones, seamounts, thermocline depth)\n\nClimate modes of variability (e.g., ENSO)\n\nHow do large-scale climate patterns influence megafauna distributions?\nOptions for representation: indices (e.g., Ni√±o 3.4), anomalies, phase states\nHow do we integrate these into models (e.g., as covariates, temporal strata)?\n\nOcean fronts and dynamic features\n\nWhat methods or datasets are currently being used to model thermal/dynamical fronts?\nCan we incorporate front metrics (e.g., SST gradients, FSLE)?\nTemporal variability: how do fronts shift seasonally or with climate anomalies?\n\nOpen discussion: Which variables are feasible to include now vs.¬†in future phases?\n\nBased on current data access and modeling capacity\nTrade-offs between variable resolution, frequency, and model performance\nWhat proxy variables or gap-filling strategies can be used in the interim?\nCan we build modular models that allow phased integration as data improves?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLunch break (12.30 - 13.00)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSession 4: Data Availability and Regional Contributions (13:00- 15:00)\n\n\n\n\nFocus:: This session will give us a clearer picture of what core datasets (physical, biogeochemical, and climate) are already in use across the region, and where key gaps or overlaps may exist.
